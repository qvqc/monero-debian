Comment:
 File <src/crypto/crypto_ops_builder/README.md> describes some code
 as being copyright Daniel Bernstein and others.
 Contents of <http://hyperelliptic.org/ebats/supercop-20141124.tar.bz2>,
 referenced in <src/crypto/crypto_ops_builder/ref10/description>,
 indicate however that those original authors dedicated their work
 to the public domain,
 and therefore Monero is the only copyright holder of that code.
